description: Mante et. al. showed how neurons with complex response coordinate together to do computations of selective integrations in monkey PFC. They trained an siRNN to model the psychophysical behavior of monkeys. By analyzing the modeled siRNN using theory of linear dynamical system, the response of siRNN fits almost perfectly with monkey data in the population level. Furthermore, siRNN produced a novel mechanism to unify selection and integration in a single circuit in terms of line attractor and selection vector.
