title: Learning function from structure in neuromorphic networks
date: 2021-09-08 19:00:00
description: Human brain can perform various of cognitive tasks and is able to flexibly learn new tasks without interfering other tasks. Whether and how the learning and computing capability is inherited from the brain connectomes remains unknown. This work tried to link the learning function and brain connectome in the framework of reservoir computing. They showed that the brain connectome outperform random network at crtical dynamical regime. Futhermore, they found that functional parcellation helps regulate the information flow which might facilitate the cognitive computation in brain
