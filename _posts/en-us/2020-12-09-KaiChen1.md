- Due to the chaotic nature, conventional BP fails in training RNN. Reservoir computing, using the echo-state property of RNNs, trains the output weight without manipulating the random reservoir current connectivity, and is capable to performing different tasks.

- Compared with ESN (Jaeger 2004), FORCE algorithm is more robust against perturbations, and is more capable of multi-task continual learning.

- The training dynamics and property of well-trained network were investigated.
  
- During training, weights along eigenvectors with larger eigenvalues converge first, and the network encode task ability with multiple eigen-modes.

- Well trained networks have fixed projections along first few eigenvectors and accompanied with flexible projections alone rest of eigenvectors.
