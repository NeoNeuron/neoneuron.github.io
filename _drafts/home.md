## Research Experience

### **Effective Inference of Functional Connectivity from ECoG Data Using TDMI**

01/2021 - Present

<font color=gray>
Developed the pipeline of causal inference based on time-delayed mutual information (TDMI) and applied onto Macaque ECoG Data.<br/>
Significant improvements of reconstruction correctness of structural connectivity based on our pipeline was achieved comparied with Granger causality (GC).
</font>

### **Modeling Attentional Modulated Spike Count Correlation (Rsc) in Macaque V1**

12/2019 - Present

<font color=gray>
Modeled the modulation of trial-by-trial variablity by spatial attention in delayed-color-change-detection experiments for macaque.<br/>
Proposed the role of inhibitory neurons in the attentional modulation of spike count correlation, and varified with mean field theory analysis.

### **Causal Inference of Neuronal Data Based on Time-delayed Mutual Information**

07/2017 - 12/2018

<font color=gray>

Developed the pipline of causal inference based on time-delayed mutual information (TDMI) analysis across multi-types of neuronal signals, between spike trains and local field potentials (LFPs).<br/>
Determined the qualitative relation between coupling strength and causal strength.<br/>
Determined the applicable dynamical regime for TDMI, and reveal the difference between excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the inference.<br/>

### **Study of Network Dynamics Based on Integrate-and-Fire Neuron Model**

02/2016 - 06/2017

<font color=gray>

Developed the point-neuronal simulator for large scale network simulation. Supporting multi-types of point neuronal models with up to 4th order global convergence (based on Runge-Kutta algorithm).<br/>
Simulated dynamics of 'small-world' networks and investigated network oscillations under different dynamical regimes.<br/>

</font>

### **Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) of Micro-Scale Samples**

09/2014 - 06/2015

<font color=gray>

Developed CDI retrieval algorithm, and tested it with numerical samples. <br/>
Participated in designing and constructing optical system for laser-based CDI. Retrieved the structure of samples with ~2um spatial resolution.

### **Femtosecond Pump-probe Spectroscopy (FPPS) of Protein Photosynthesis**

08/2016 - 09/2016

<font color=gray>

Participated in building optical systems of NOPAs and FPPS, and studied the electron transfer process of the P450cam system. <br/>
Modified FPPS system with lock-in amplifier and reconstructed reaction modes based on global analysis simulations with sequential photosynthesis models.
