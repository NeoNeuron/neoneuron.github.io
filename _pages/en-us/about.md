🌟 I study the brain 🧠, mainly using math and numerical analysis to unravel its complexities.

🌟 I like coding and related technical stuffs 👨🏻‍💻, ideally when they are fun to play with.

🌟 I’m an amateur powerlifter 🏋🏻‍♂️. Heavy objects go up, sometimes on purpose.

🌟 I love road cycling 🚴🏻‍♂️, usually as a way to think about work and life while pretending not to.

I'm currently exploring France 🇫🇷 as my new territory of life, working as a [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en) postdoctoral researcher
at the [Laboratoire de Neurosciences Cognitives & Computationnelles](https://lnc2.dec.ens.fr/en),
[École Normale Supérieure (ENS)](https://www.ens.psl.eu/) in Paris, working with Dr. [Srdjan Ostojic](https://lnc2.dec.ens.fr/en/teams/network-dynamics-and-computations), also known as the "low-rank" group.

Before that, I accomplished my Ph.D. training in Applied Mathematics at the [Lab of Computational Neuroscience](https://lcns-sjtu.github.io), [Institute of Natural Science](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn), under the supervision of Prof. [Douglas Zhou](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/people/zdz/) and Prof. [Songting Li](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/people/songtingli/).

Earlier still, I studied physics for both my master’s and bachelor’s degrees at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

**Research Interests**: Computational Neuroscience, Machine Learning, Applied Mathematics.

- Network dynamics and computations.
  1. How perception and cognition conducted through **multi-regional network dynamics** in brain.
  2. The relationship between **network connectivity**, **network dynamics**, and **network functions**.
  3. **Biologically plausible learning rules** for recurrent neural networks.
- Neural coding and data analysis.
  1. Linking **structural**, **functional**, and **effective connectivity** using multi-modal neural data.
  2. The principle underlying **spike temporal coding**
- Temporal proception in the brain (my current ERC project CHRONOLOGY).
  1. How the cortical network represent varying **time durations** in terms of population dynamics.
  2. How the neural dynamics bind independent memory items sequentially onto the neural manifold in the **temporal order**.
  3. Can we parametrically manipulate the network dynamics to systemetically perturb the **temporal perception** and change the **working memory** capacity?
