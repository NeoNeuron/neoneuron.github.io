I'm interested in studying the brain 🧠.

I'm a fan of technical stuffs and programming 👨🏻‍💻.

I'm an amateur powerlifter 🏋🏻‍♂️.

I love road cycling 🚴🏻‍♂️.

Currently, I'm an applied mathematics PhD candidate from the [Lab of Computational Neuroscience](https://lcns-sjtu.github.io) at [Institute of Natural Science](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn), under the supervision of Prof. [Douglas Zhou](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/people/zdz/).

Before that, I studied physics in the master program at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

Before that, I also studied physics and got my bachelor degree in physics at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
