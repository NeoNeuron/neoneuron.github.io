Tian, Songting Li, David W. McLaughlin, Douglas Zhou</p> <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: We investigate causal connectivity in nonlinear networks with pulse signals as measured output, using four commonly used causality measures. We establish a direct link between the inferred causal and structural connectivity, demonstrating that the causal connectivity inferred by any of the four measures coincides with the underlying structural connectivity. And our pairwise reconstruction framework of structural connectivity can be achieved without conditioning on global network information, providing an effective approach for pulse-output network reconstruction.</p> </body></html>
