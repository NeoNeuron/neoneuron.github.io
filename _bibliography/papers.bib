    abstract = {Granger causality (GC) stands as a powerful causal inference tool in time series analysis. Typically estimated from time series data with finite sampling rate, the GC value inherently depends on the sampling interval $\tau.$ Intuitively, a higher data sampling rate leads to a time series that better approximates the real signal. However, previous studies have shown that the bivariate GC converges to zero linearly as $\tau$ approaches zero, which will lead to mis-inference of causality due to vanishing GC value even in the presence of causality. In this work, by performing mathematical analysis, we show this asymptotic behavior remains valid in the case of conditional GC when applying to a system composed of more than two variables. We validate the analytical result by computing GC value with multiple sampling rates for the simulated data of Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal networks and the experimental data of intracranial EEG signals. Our result demonstrates the hazard of GC inference with high sampling rate, and we propose an accurate inference approach by calculating the ratio of GC to $\tau$ as $\tau$ approaches zero.},

    author = {Tian, Zhong-qi K. and Chen, Kai and Li, Songting and McLaughlin, David W. and Zhou, Douglas},
    abstract = {The causal connectivity of a network is often inferred to understand network function. It is arguably acknowledged that the inferred causal connectivity relies on the causality measure one applies, and it may differ from the network’s underlying structural connectivity. However, the interpretation of causal connectivity remains to be fully clarified, in particular, how causal connectivity depends on causality measures and how causal connectivity relates to structural connectivity. Here, we focus on nonlinear networks with pulse signals as measured output, e.g., neural networks with spike output, and address the above issues based on four commonly utilized causality measures, i.e., time-delayed correlation coefficient, time-delayed mutual information, Granger causality, and transfer entropy. We theoretically show how these causality measures are related to one another when applied to pulse signals. Taking a simulated Hodgkin–Huxley network and a real mouse brain network as two illustrative examples, we further verify the quantitative relations among the four causality measures and demonstrate that the causal connectivity inferred by any of the four well coincides with the underlying network structural connectivity, therefore illustrating a direct link between the causal and structural connectivity. We stress that the structural connectivity of pulse-output networks can be reconstructed pairwise without conditioning on the global information of all other nodes in a network, thus circumventing the curse of dimensionality. Our framework provides a practical and effective approach for pulse-output network reconstruction.},

We investigate networks with pulse signal as measured output and solve the above reverse-engineering issue by establishing a direct link between the network{\textquoteright}s causal connectivity and structural connectivity. Here, the causal connectivity can be inferred by any one of the four causality measures, i.e., time-delayed correlation coefficient, time-delayed mutual information, Granger causality, and transfer entropy. We analytically reveal the relationship among these four measures and show that they are equally effective to fully reconstruct the network connectivity pairwise. Our work provides a practical framework to reconstruct the structural connectivity in general pulse-output nonlinear networks or subnetworks.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
